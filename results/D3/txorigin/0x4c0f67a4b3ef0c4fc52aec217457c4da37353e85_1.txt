=============Contract: TattooMoneyPublicSaleIV
Sink:
To identify the **Sink** operations in the provided smart contract, we will analyze each function for security-sensitive operations that may lead to access control vulnerabilities. We will focus on operations that transfer tokens or Ether, modify critical state variables, or change ownership without proper access control.

### Analysis:

1. **Function: `payUSDC`, `payUSDT`, `payDAI`, `paywBTC`, `payETH`, `receive`**
   - These functions allow users to pay with different tokens or Ether. They update `tokensSold` and `tokensBoughtOf` for the user. However, they are protected by the `notEnded` modifier, which ensures the sale is ongoing and within the specified date range. The operations are expected behavior for a token sale and do not constitute a sink.

2. **Function: `_sendTokens`**
   - This internal function transfers TAT2 tokens to the user. It is called by the payment functions and is protected by the `notEnded` modifier. The transfer operation is part of the expected token sale process and does not constitute a sink.

3. **Function: `takeAll`**
   - This function allows the owner to transfer all collected tokens and Ether to themselves. It is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring only the contract owner can execute it. This is a sensitive operation but is properly access-controlled, so it is not a sink.

4. **Function: `recoverErc20`**
   - This function allows the owner to recover any ERC20 tokens sent to the contract. It is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring only the contract owner can execute it. This is a sensitive operation but is properly access-controlled, so it is not a sink.

5. **Function: `recoverEth`**
   - This function allows the owner to recover any Ether sent to the contract. It is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring only the contract owner can execute it. This is a sensitive operation but is properly access-controlled, so it is not a sink.

6. **Function: `EndSale`**
   - This function allows the owner to end the sale. It is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring only the contract owner can execute it. This is a sensitive operation but is properly access-controlled, so it is not a sink.

7. **Function: `changeOwner` and `acceptOwnership`**
   - These functions handle ownership transfer. `changeOwner` is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, and `acceptOwnership` requires the caller to be the `newOwner`. These operations are sensitive but are properly access-controlled, so they are not sinks.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the contract, all sensitive operations are properly protected by access control mechanisms, such as the `onlyOwner` modifier. Therefore, no operations in this contract constitute a sink.
